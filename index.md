These pages describes methods for designing **API Management compatible API's with Clear business orientation and best practice architecture patters**. Methods are re-interpreted from proven processes like [DevOps (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), [Business Model Canvas (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas) and [API Model Canvas](https://www.slideshare.net/3scale/api-model-canvas-apidays-mediterranea-2015). APIOps&reg; Cyles is created in collaboration with open non-profit [APIOps.net Community](https://medium.com/apiops) and [Digia Plc](www.digia.com).

**RESTful API**'s are in the core of services. One major difference to normal API development is that API's are considered as products, not unique services. APi's are owned, improved continuosly and should be advocated for the consumers. They can be sold and bought and they are the lifeblood to the applications using them. The API's should provide not only value to your consumers but should be appealing to developers. They should be easy to understand, discover and use, a set of API's should always be consistent. API's can be used by several consumers; applications or even devices.

**[Zalando RestAPI design Principles: "RESTful API as a Product makes the difference between enterprise integration business and agile, innovative product service business built on a platform of APIs."](http://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/design-principles/DesignPrinciples.html)**

All methods used are **technology agnostic**. Used technology to create, manage, release and test the API's should be evaluated per purpose. Open source technologies as well as commercial products are possible to use with APIOps&reg; Cycles.

**APIOps&reg; goal is to design, build, test and release APIs more rapidly, frequently and reliably.**
