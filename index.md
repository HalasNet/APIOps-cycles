These pages describes methods for designing API Management compatible API's with Clear business orientation and best practice architecture patters. Methods are re-interpreted from proven processes like [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), Business Model Canvas and API Model Canvas.

RESTful API's are in the core of services. One major difference to normal API development is that API's are considered as products, not unique services. API can be used by several consumers; applications or even devices. API's can be sold and bought and they are the lifeblood to the applications using them.

All methods used are technology agnostic. Used technology to create, manage, release and test the API's should be evaluated per purpose. Open source technologies as well as commercial products are possible to use with APIOps&reg; Cycles.

APIOps&reg; goal is to design, build, test and release APIs more rapidly, frequently and reliably.
