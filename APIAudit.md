API Audit is a method to ensure APIs are matching the API Design guidelines and ensure the API meets the best practice criteria for usability and security and can be published via API management to the API consumers.

This check list is intented to be used before API is published, after and during the implementation.

Any "No" answers must have an explanation in the comment field. Those implementations should be fixed as soon as possible or as a minimum should be peer-reviewed carefully to validate the reason.

OWASP -security criteria refers to the [OWASP security cheat sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet).

Use [API Audit form](apiauditform) to audit the existing API or to prepare for designing or publishing your new API.
